description: To achieve that objective, our Federal permitting and review processes
  must provide a transparent, consistent, and predictable path for both project sponsors
  and affected communities. They must ensure that agencies set and adhere to timelines
  and schedules for completion of reviews, set clear permitting performance goals,
  and track progress against those goals. They must encourage early collaboration
  among agencies, project sponsors, and affected stakeholders in order to incorporate
  and address their interests and minimize delays.
